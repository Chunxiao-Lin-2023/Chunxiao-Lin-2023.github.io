excerpt: '<span style="color: blue;">Author List: Dake Chen, Chunxiao Lin, Peter A Beerel</span><br> 
          This paper proposed a novel GF(2)-based flush attack that breaks even the most rigorous version of state-of-the-art dynamic defenses.
          Our attack is proven to be over 4300x faster than the state-of-the-art SAT-based attacks.<br>
          <b>My contributions in this work are:</b><br>
          (1)Developed a Python script to transfer bench format netlist into Verilog circuit and add dynamic encrypted logic into it.<br>
          (2)Improved the verification part of a scan-based attack by verifying the Math model with the simulation on Modelsim.
