excerpt: '<span style="color: blue;">Author List: Chunxiao Lin, Muhammad Farhan Azmine, Yang Yi</span><br> 
          This paper introduces a neuro-inspired AI accelerator for the massive MIMO-OFDM symbol detection task in the wireless domain.
          We Applied the ESN method to the massive MIMO scenario and accelerated the symbol detector with a DSP-based architecture.<br>
          <b>My contributions in this work are:</b><br>
          (1) Proposed an ESN-based symbol detector for the massive MIMO-OFDM system.<br>
          (2) Verified the performance and efficiency with sufficient simulations for different MIMO configurations.
          (3) Validated the architecture through a proof-of-concept implementation on the Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA board.
