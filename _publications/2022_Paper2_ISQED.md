excerpt: '<span style="color: blue;">Author List: Chunxiao Lin, Yibin Liang, Yang Yi</span><br> 
          This paper introduces a low-cost architecture for the reservoir neurons in echo state networks(ESNs).
          We adopt the bit-serial matrix multiplier and direct spatial implementation of the weight matrix to fully exploit the sparseness property.<br>
          <b>My contributions in this work are:</b><br>
          (1) Developed a bit-serial vector-matrix multiplier for the ESN reservoir state updating.<br>
          (2) Introduced zero-skipping logic optimizations to exploit the sparsity of the ESN weight matrix.<br>
          (3) Adopted the canonical signed digit representation to increase the sparsity in bit level, which boosts the performance of the proposed architecture.<br>
