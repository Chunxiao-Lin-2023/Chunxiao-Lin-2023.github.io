excerpt: '<span style="color: blue;">Author List: Chunxiao Lin, Muhammad Farhan Azmine, Yang Yi</span><br> 
          This paper introduces an FPGA-based AI accelerator for the MIMO-OFDM symbol detection task in the wireless domain.
          We introduced a low-cost, low-power architecture for the ESN neurons using the DSP48E1 slices in the Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA board.<br>
          <b>My contributions in this work are:</b><br>
          (1) Developed a DSP-based MAC operation block design for both the reservoir neurons and output neurons.<br>
          (2) Designed a fixed-point number system for the FPGA-based ESN, including the MAC operations and the non-linear tanh function.<br>
          (3) Applied the FPGA-based ESN design to the real-world, real-time wireless communication task: 2x2 MIMO-OFDM symbol detection.<br>
          (4) Developed an SDR/FPGA joint platform for the testing of the ESN-based symbol detectors.<br>
