          In this paper, we proposed an FPGA-based recursive least squares (RLS) learning architecture for complete on-chip ESN training.
          Architectural optimizations are also explored in both ESN inference and RLS training for a mobile MIMO channel prediction task. <br>
          <b>My contributions in this work are:</b><br>
          (1) Implemented the recursive least squares algorithm on FPGA.
          (2) Proposed a systolic-array-based matrix-vector multiplication design, which enhances both the reservoir layer and output layer.
          (3) Integrated both the inference and training circuits into a unified, real-time ESN system with a Q-format fixed-point design.
          (4) Applied the FPGA-based on-chip ESN system to the mobile MIMO channel prediction task.
