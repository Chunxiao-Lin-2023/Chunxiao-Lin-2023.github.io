          In this book chapter,  we provide a comprehensive introduction to AI-powered solutions
          in the FPGA CAD design flow, focusing on crucial steps such as high-level synthesis (HLS),
          logic synthesis, placement, and routing. Comparisons between AI-based
          methods and conventional methods are generated to show the advantages of the
          integration of AI in different steps.
